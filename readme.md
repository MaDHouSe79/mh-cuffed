# MH Walk When Cuffed

# For Players
- When you get cuffed by a cop you don't walk or move, with this script you also walk/run with the cop while cuffed.
- so when the cop is walking or running you are also automaticly going to walk or run animation.

# For Npc's
- You can Cuff/UnCuff, Search, Escort, Hostage, Surender or place Npc's in your vehicle for a cop chase.
- When a npc is cuffed the npc walk/run with you while you move around.

# Add code in `qb-policejob` (client side)
- in `qb-policejob/client/main.lua` at the bottom of the file.
```lua
local function GetIsHandcuffed() return isHandcuffed end
exports('GetIsHandcuffed', GetIsHandcuffed)
```
